Spin&Dare requires basic Kotlin gradle and android sdk to build.
I used latest android studio

A classic party bottle game except you roll from 4 types of predefined cards.
Physical touch
fun dare
crazy dare
suble dare


Spicy version:

each person chooses color you can do count 1 2 3 4 in groups side by side to determine colors.
Take off part of your clothes on each color roll that matches yours.
last naked wins.
